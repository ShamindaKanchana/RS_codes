## Performance Testing Methodology

### How We Tested

The performance statistics shown were collected using Linux's `perf` tool, which provides detailed hardware and software event monitoring. The benchmark was executed with the following command:

```bash
perf stat -e task-clock,cycles,instructions,cache-references,cache-misses ./parallel_benchmark
```

### Interpreting the Results

Here's what each metric in the performance counter output means:

```
1,512,881.49 msec task-clock     # Total CPU time used (1,512.88 seconds)
2,409,957,552,044 cycles         # Total CPU cycles
4,197,734,108,325 instructions   # Total instructions executed
1.74 insn per cycle             # Instructions per cycle (IPC)
3,813,389,736 cache-references   # Cache accesses
730,779,747 cache-misses        # Cache misses (19.16% miss rate)
```

Key insights from these metrics:
- **Task-clock**: The total CPU time used (1,512.88 seconds)
- **Instructions per Cycle (IPC)**: 1.74 indicates good instruction-level parallelism
- **Cache Miss Rate**: 19.16% suggests some memory access bottlenecks
- **Total Time**: The benchmark completed in ~500.67 seconds of wall-clock time

### Running Performance Tests

#### On Ubuntu Linux (tested environment)

The performance statistics shown in this document were collected on an Ubuntu Linux system using the `perf` tool. Here's how to reproduce these measurements:

1. Install required tools:
   ```bash
   # Install perf and other performance tools
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install linux-tools-common linux-tools-generic linux-tools-$(uname -r)
   
   # For flame graph generation (optional)
   sudo apt-get install git
   git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/brendangregg/FlameGraph
   export PATH="$PATH:$(pwd)/FlameGraph"
   ```

2. Run the benchmark with performance monitoring:
   ```bash
   # Basic performance counters
   perf stat -e task-clock,cycles,instructions,cache-references,cache-misses ./parallel_benchmark
   
   # More detailed analysis
   perf stat -d ./parallel_benchmark
   
   # Generate a flame graph (visualize CPU usage)
   perf record -g ./parallel_benchmark
   perf script | stackcollapse-perf.pl | flamegraph.pl > flamegraph.svg
   ```

3. For continuous monitoring:
   ```bash
   watch -n 1 "perf stat -e task-clock,cycles,instructions,cache-references,cache-misses -a sleep 1 2>&1 | grep -E 'task-clock|instructions|cache-misses'"
   ```

#### Windows Performance Analysis

For Windows users, you can use the following tools to analyze performance:

1. **Windows Performance Recorder (WPR) & Windows Performance Analyzer (WPA)**
   - Pre-installed on Windows 10/11 (search for "Windows Performance Recorder" in Start)
   - Steps to use:
     1. Open Windows Performance Recorder
     2. Select "First Level" or "CPU Usage" profile
     3. Click "Start" and run your benchmark
     4. Click "Save" to stop recording
     5. Open the .etl file in Windows Performance Analyzer (WPA)

2. **Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) with perf**
   - Install WSL2 with Ubuntu
   - Install perf in WSL:
     ```bash
     sudo apt update
     sudo apt install linux-tools-common linux-tools-generic linux-tools-$(uname -r)
     ```
   - Use perf commands as shown in the Linux section

3. **Visual Studio Profiler** (if using Visual Studio)
   - Built into Visual Studio 2019/2022
   - Go to Debug > Performance Profiler
   - Select "Performance Profiler" and click Start

**Windows Limitations:**
- WPR/WPA has higher overhead than Linux's perf
- Some low-level hardware counters may not be accessible
- Memory usage metrics might be less detailed than Linux
- WSL2 performance characteristics may differ from native Linux

#### macOS Performance Analysis

For macOS users:
- **Instruments** (part of Xcode)
- **`dtrace`** (command-line tool)
- **`sample`** command for stack sampling

#### Other Linux Distributions
Package names and installation commands may vary. For example:
- **Fedora/CentOS/RHEL**: `sudo dnf install perf`
- **Arch Linux**: `sudo pacman -S perf`
- **openSUSE**: `sudo zypper install perf`

## Scheduling Strategy Analysis

### Static vs Dynamic Scheduling

The benchmark implements two OpenMP scheduling strategies for parallel block processing:

#### Static Scheduling
```cpp
#pragma omp parallel for schedule(static)
for (size_t i = 0; i < blocks.size(); ++i) {
    // Process block i
}
```
- **How it works**:
  - Divides iterations into equal-sized chunks
  - Each thread gets one chunk
  - Assignment is fixed at the start
- **Best for**:
  - Uniform work distribution
  - Minimal scheduling overhead
  - Predictable performance

#### Dynamic Scheduling
```cpp
#pragma omp parallel for schedule(dynamic, 32)
for (size_t i = 0; i < blocks.size(); ++i) {
    // Process block i
}
```
- **How it works**:
  - Creates a pool of work chunks (32 blocks/chunk)
  - Threads grab chunks as they become available
  - Better load balancing for variable workloads
- **Best for**:
  - Variable work per iteration
  - Systems with load imbalance
  - Maximizing CPU utilization

### Performance Comparison

#### Throughput (MB/s) - 10M bases, 8 threads
| Test Case          | Static | Dynamic | Difference |
|--------------------|--------|---------|------------|
| 0 errors/block    | 2.52   | 2.56    | +1.6%      |
| 1 error/block     | 2.32   | 2.36    | +1.7%      |
| 2 errors/block    | 2.26   | 2.28    | +0.9%      |

#### Thread Scaling (1M bases, 0 errors)
| Threads | Static (MB/s) | Dynamic (MB/s) | Speedup (vs 1 thread) |
|---------|---------------|----------------|-----------------------|
| 1       | 0.64          | 0.67           | 1.00x                 |
| 2       | 1.26          | 1.27           | 1.90x                 |
| 4       | 2.43          | 2.43           | 3.63x                 |
| 8       | 2.49          | 2.52           | 3.76x                 |

### Key Findings
1. **Minimal Performance Difference**:
   - Dynamic shows 0.9-1.7% better throughput
   - Both scale similarly up to 4 threads
   - Performance plateaus at 8 threads

2. **Recommendation**:
   - Use `static` scheduling for this workload
   - Consider `dynamic` if work becomes more variable
   - Chunk size of 32 provides good balance

## Implementation Details

The system implements a highly optimized parallel processing pipeline:

1. **Parallel Processing Architecture**:
   - Uses OpenMP's dynamic scheduling for optimal load balancing
   - Implements thread-local random number generation to prevent contention
   - Utilizes cache-aligned data structures to minimize false sharing

2. **Encoding Pipeline**:
   - Input DNA is split into 11-byte blocks (k=11)

   - Minimal synchronization overhead

3. **Throughput Optimization**:
   - Batch processing of blocks
   - Vectorized operations where possible
   - Reduced branching in critical paths
