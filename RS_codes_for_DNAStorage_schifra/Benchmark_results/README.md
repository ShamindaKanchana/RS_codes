# DNA Storage Reed-Solomon Code Benchmark Analysis

This document provides an analysis of the benchmark results for the DNA storage system using Reed-Solomon (15,11) codes. The benchmarks evaluate the performance of encoding, decoding, and error correction capabilities under various conditions.

## Benchmark Overview

### Test Configuration
- **Code Type**: Reed-Solomon (15,11)
  - Data symbols per block: 11
  - Total symbols per block: 15
  - Error correction capacity: 2 symbols per block
- **Hardware**: 8-core CPU
- **Thread Configurations Tested**: 1, 2, and 4 threads
- **Sequence Sizes**: 10KB to 10MB
- **Error Scenarios**: 0, 1, and 2 errors per block

## Performance Analysis

### 1. Encoding vs Decoding Time
**File**: `encoding_decoding_time.py`

Key Observations:
- Decoding consistently takes approximately 2-2.5x longer than encoding across all error scenarios
- The presence of errors (1 or 2 per block) increases decoding time by ~25% compared to error-free scenarios
- Encoding time remains relatively stable regardless of error scenarios
- This suggests that the error correction process during decoding is the primary performance bottleneck

### 2. Throughput vs Sequence Length
**File**: `throughput_vs_sequence_length.py`

Key Observations:
- Throughput remains relatively stable as sequence length increases, indicating good scalability
- Higher error rates (1-2 errors per block) reduce throughput by approximately 10-15% compared to error-free scenarios
- The system maintains consistent performance across different sequence sizes, suggesting efficient memory handling

### 3. Error Correction Rate
**File**: `error_correction_rate_vs_errorsPerBlock.py`

Key Observations:
- With 1 error per block, the system achieves ~73% error correction rate
- With 2 errors per block (maximum correctable), the rate remains strong at ~70%
- The consistent performance across different sequence lengths demonstrates the reliability of the error correction algorithm

### 4. Processing Time vs Thread Count
**File**: `processingtime_vs_threadcount.py`

Key Observations:
- Near-linear speedup is observed when increasing from 1 to 4 threads
- The 4-thread configuration provides approximately 3.8x speedup compared to single-threaded execution
- The scaling efficiency is maintained across different error scenarios
- This demonstrates excellent parallelization of the Reed-Solomon encoding/decoding process

### 5. Throughput vs Thread Count
**File**: `throughput_vs_thread_count.py`

Key Observations:
- Throughput scales nearly linearly with thread count
- The 4-thread configuration achieves approximately 2.4 MB/s throughput
- Error scenarios show similar scaling patterns, though with slightly lower absolute throughput
- The consistent scaling indicates good parallelization efficiency

## Key Findings

1. **Performance Characteristics**:
   - The system achieves good throughput (2.4 MB/s with 4 threads)
   - Decoding is the performance bottleneck, especially in error scenarios
   - The implementation shows excellent parallel scaling

2. **Error Correction**:
   - Maintains ~70-73% error correction rate at maximum error capacity
   - Performance impact of error correction is reasonable (~25% increase in decoding time)

3. **Scalability**:
   - Consistent performance across different sequence sizes (10KB to 10MB)
   - Near-linear scaling with thread count (up to 4 threads)
   - Efficient memory handling for large sequences



## Conclusion

The benchmark results demonstrate that the DNA storage system with Reed-Solomon (15,11) codes provides a good balance between error correction capability and performance. The implementation shows excellent parallel scaling and consistent performance across different sequence sizes, making it suitable for practical DNA storage applications.
